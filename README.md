# Experimental-Code
This depository includes various experimental code. This may include novel estimators and experimental algorithms. 

In general, this code is not necessarily ready for use in real data analyses, expect perhaps by a very advanced user. 
However, many of these programs may be of interest to those doing research in theoretical statistics.
